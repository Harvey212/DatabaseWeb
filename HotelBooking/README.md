# Hotel Booking

This is the hotel booking system that I built.


## Front page design.

## When you click on button of the roomtype you are interested in, the window would pop up to let you know more details of it.

## When you tried to book the room for your trip, the system would ask you to log in your account. If you do not have an account, you could sign up and the system would direct you to the registration page.
